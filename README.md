# Identification_Medicinal_Plants
Using python and it's libraries such as Keras(Preprocessing and ImageDataGenerator), Tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib I have developed this project in which the dataset contains
30 no. of classes and with 900 different images with 96% accuracy.

Sorry about the error, the error is coming due to I have released execution of the line cnn.fit and it's causing a KeyboardInterrupt.
