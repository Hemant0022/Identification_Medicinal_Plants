# Identification_Medicinal_Plants
Using python and it's libraries such as Keras(Preprocessing and ImageDataGenerator), Tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib I have developed this project in which the dataset contains
30 no. of classes and with 900 different images with 96% accuracy.

-> For better result, accuracy and efficicency of the model train it with large no. of epochs and more different types of images.
